# Visualizations of Baseball Data Trends

This project leverages a SQL database and REST API to analyze and visualize interesting trends in baseball data. By structuring the data into a well-defined schema and optimizing queries, the website provides interactive visualizations that offer insights into five select aspects of baseball statistics.

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is deployed on **Oracle Cloud DB and Compute**. After the initial completion, I (Alec) migrated the app and database to my personal Oracle Cloud instance for public access. Interested developers can find the deployment-specific modifications in the **Oracle deployment branch**.
